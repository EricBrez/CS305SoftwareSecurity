# CS305SoftwareSecurity

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client, Artiemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers which include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial hired Global Rain in the process of modernizing their operation including their software, a RESTful API. Global Rain's goal is to assess and advise Artemis Financial on the best ways to secure its assets against external threats.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?I believe I did well with documenting vulnerabilities but had/have a lot to work on when it comes to mitigating them, even still, as shown by my second project and a few assignments throughout the course I have a long way to go and need to put extra effort into making sure I am executing secure code well. Being able to securely code and practice good security in software development can do well for a companys wellbeing, from it's overall public reputation and good product to it's employees personal wellbeing, securely coding and having the company not be known for allowing attacks is crucial for the company's survival in a competitive and vital field.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The manual review of code was the most challenging for me. Determining vulnerabilities from looking at code felt foreign and I did not feel prepared when the time came and with being able to find few resources to assist I did not really know where to look and struggled with the assignment.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
My mitigation plan included improving input validation, making sure that the correct and most secure, most recent JDK, Spring, and Tomcat, and ensuring that solid encryption was being utilized to secure data.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I attempted to make certain that the code was secure by deploying the SHA-256 hash cipher algorithm, I was unable to successfully reconfigure the HTTP protocol to the HTTPS protocol in time for the project turn in, but I ran multiple dependency checks to take care of which vulnerabilities were there.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
OWASP Dependency Checker, and OWASP in general as well as oracle and resources on how to generate self signed certificates was helpful in this course and will be able to provide good advice for future developments.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
In the interest of showing improvement, ability to learn, and growth I could show my product from Project 2 if and only if I was able to also show another project that I will inevitably work on that has the skills down and mastered that I was unable to master during this course else I believe that it would ultimately work against me due to my failure to complete.
